 EZCAD2 Automation  An enhanced integration solution for automating EZCAD2 operations with Excel data using a specialized C# bridge component.  ## Overview  This application provides a bridge between Excel spreadsheets and EZCAD2 laser marking software. It allows for automated text updates and marking operations by reading data from Excel files and updating text fields in EZCAD2 templates.  ## Key Features  - Excel data integration with EZCAD2 templates - Direct communication with EZCAD2 via MarkEzd.dll - Automated batch processing - Template entity inspection - Profile management for saved configurations - Comprehensive logging  ## System Requirements  - Windows operating system (required for EZCAD2 and MarkEzd.dll) - EZCAD2 software installed - Python 3.7 or higher - .NET Framework 4.8 (for C# bridge component) - Required Python packages:   - pandas   - watchdog   - psutil  ## Setup Instructions  ### 1. Build the C# Bridge Component  1. Open the EZCADIntegration directory in Visual Studio 2. Build the EZCADBridge project 3. Copy MarkEzd.dll from your EZCAD2 installation directory to the bin/Release directory of the EZCADBridge project  ### 2. Configure the Application  1. Launch the application 2. Go to the Settings tab 3. Set the following paths:    - Bridge EXE: Path to the EZCADBridge.exe    - Output Directory: Directory for saving processed templates (optional) 4. Save your settings as a profile  ### 3. Usage  #### Processing Excel Data  1. Load an Excel file 2. Select an EZD template 3. Click "List Entities" to view available text entities 4. Click "Process Excel" to update the template with data and execute marking  ## Component Architecture  The application consists of these main components:  1. Main Application - User interface and workflow management 2. Excel Handler - Loading and processing Excel files 3. Integration Module - Coordinates Excel processing with EZCAD operations 4. EZCAD Bridge - Python interface to the C# bridge component 5. C# Bridge - Direct communication with EZCAD2 via MarkEzd.dll  ## File Formats  ### Excel Files  The application expects Excel files with columns that match the entity names in your EZD templates. For example, if your template has text entities named "SerialNumber" and "Date", your Excel should have columns with these exact names.  ### EZD Templates  Standard EZCAD2 template files (*.ezd) with text entities that can be updated programmatically.  ## Troubleshooting  ### Bridge Connection Issues  - Ensure MarkEzd.dll is in the same directory as EZCADBridge.exe - Verify EZCAD2 is properly installed - Check if the bridge executable path is correctly set in settings  ### Excel Processing Issues  - Ensure column names match entity names in the template - Verify Excel file format is supported (.xls or .xlsx) - Check the log tab for detailed error messages anlat bunu türkçe aolarak adım adım
